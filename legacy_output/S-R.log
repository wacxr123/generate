Context: Question:$\frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{x^2+3x-1}{x+1} \right)$
Step  1 :  To find the derivative of the given function, we'll apply the quotient rule, which states that if $f(x) = \frac{g(x)}{h(x)}$, then the derivative $f'(x)$ is given by $f' (x)=\frac {h(x)g'(x)-g(x)h'(x)}{[h(x)]^{2}}$.

Step2:  We identify $g(x)=x^{2} + 3x - 1$ and $h (x) = x + 1$. Then, we find their derivatives: $g'( x) = 2x +  3$ and  $h'( x ) = 1 $.

Question: How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?
Step 1: to determine the asymptotes, we should find the zero point of $y=\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$.
Step 2: to find the zero point, we have to factor the $x^2+x-6$.
To be regenerated step: Step 3:factor $x^2+x-6$, which is $(x-3)(x+2)$
Instruction: $x^2+x-6$ doesn't equal to $(x-3)(x+2)$ but $(x-2)(x+3)$

regenerated step: steps 3:factor $x^2+x-6$, which is $(x+3)(x-2)$
