 verification results:
 Step 2:  First, we need to simplify each term in the expression using the properties of exponents and the definition of $i$. 
Step 3:  For the first term, $i^{5}$, we can use the fact that $ i^2 = -1$ to simplify it as follows: $ i^{5} = i^{4} \cdot i = (i^{2})^{2} \ cdot i = (-1)^{2} i = i$.
Step 5:  Next, we simplify the second term $i^{-25}$ by using the property of negative exponents, which states that $a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^{n}}$. Therefore, $ i^{-25}= \frac {1}{i^{25}}$.

Step 6:  Finally, for the third term, the remainder of $45$ when divided by  $4$ is 1. Therefore, we can simplify this as $ i^{45} = i^1 = i$.

    Step 4: the asymptotes for $x^2+x-6$ should be x=2 and x = -3.
    To be verified step: 
    So the number of asymptotes should be 2.
    
    results:\boxed{yes}
    \reasons: since the asymptotes for $x^2+x-6$ is x=2 and x=-3, the number of asymptotes should be 2.

Context:Please write the final answer with \boxed{} ###\nQuestion:Evaluate $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}$.
Step 1:  We are given the expression $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit with the property that $i^2=-1$.
The powers of $i$ follow a cycle: $i^1=i$, $i^2=-1$, $i^3=-i$, and $i^4=1$.
This cycle repeats for higher powers of $i$.
###Step 3:  We can simplify each term in the given expression by finding the remainder when the exponent is divided by $4$.
###Step 5:  For the second term, $i^{-25}$, we find the remainder when $-25$ is divided by $4$, which is $-1$.
Therefore, $i^{-25}=i^{-1}=-i$.
###Step 6:  For the third term, $i^{45}$, we find the remainder when $45$ is divided by $4$, which is $1$.
Therefore, $i^{45}=i^1=i$. 
To be verified step:Step 7:  Now that we have simplified each term, we can substitute these values back into the original expression: $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}=i+(-i)+i$.

prompt:
 You are a math problem solver. Please answer the question step by step. At the begin of each step please signify the step No. in the form 'Step No.:'. At the end of each step please output '###' to signify the end of the step.For example, in the first step, you should write in the form 'Step 1: ...
 ###'for the first step

Please write the final answer with \boxed{} ###\nQuestion:Evaluate $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}$.
Step 1:  We are given the expression $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit with the property that $i^2=-1$.
###Step 2:  To simplify this expression, we need to understand the pattern of powers of $i$. The powers of $i$ follow a cycle: $i^1=i$, $i^2=-1$, $i^3=-i$, and $i^4=1$. This cycle repeats for higher powers of $i$.
###Step 3:  We can simplify each term in the given expression by finding the remainder when the exponent is divided by $4$. This is because the powers of $i$ repeat every $4$ powers.
###Step 4:  For the first term, $i^5$, we find the remainder when $5$ is divided by $4$, which is $1$. Therefore, $i^5=i^1=i$.
###Step 5:  For the second term, $i^{-25}$, we find the remainder when $-25$ is divided by $4$, which is $-1$. Therefore, $i^{-25}=i^{-1}=-i$.
###Step 6:  For the third term, $i^{45}$, we find the remainder when $45$ is divided by $4$, which is $1$. Therefore, $i^{45}=i^1=i$.
###Step 7:  Now that we have simplified each term, we can substitute these values back into the original expression: $i^5+i^{-25}+i^{45}=i+(-i)+i$.
